## About The Project
This game was created to test my master's thesis. It is about the creation of a procedural maze and all its elements. It was developed with c ++ and Unreal Engine and I did it all by myself.

# Description
The player's goal is to find the exit to the maze. During the game, the player can interact with different objects, talk to NPCs or fight against enemies.
