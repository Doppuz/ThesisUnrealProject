Hi!,I don't think this is the right way, turn it back and try again!
Well my dear, What you are looking for is not here,go back and have a go again!
Why are you here?,You remember me of Zoro in One Piece who always gets lost.
**Why are you staring at me?!?!?**, Hi, Can I help you?
I am glad you found me, I was very upset here, no one ever come to talk with me, I see you have a lot things to do so I am not bothering you anymore, but if you wanna be my friends I am going to wait for you, Bye!
Red light, Green light, Oh I got confused.
**What am I doing here?**, Don't bother me, I am busy.
keep going!, You are very closer to the end of the maze :)
Zero, One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Eight, Nine, Ten, I have missed number 7, Have you noticed?
I bless you, I hope you can get to the end.
It is very nice to walk here, you should follow me to!
What happened?, Did you get lost?
Hi dear!, there are several routes out here, you should have a look everywhere, enjoy!
There are some bad guys out there, Red square shoot you from the distance, While Black square follow you, Watch out!
Hi Darling!, Keep going, You are doing great!
Hi adventurer!, I am keeping fit, You should try it aswell, Bye!
**The sunset today is stunning**, Oh sorry I was overthinking, Please go on and don't consider me.
Hey, Watch out from white squares, if they see you you have to start over from the last door you have visited
**This square is the ugliest I have ever seen**, Hi gorgeous, How can I help you?
Have you ever seen any hats nearby?, I stumbled upon into one yesterday, Maybe you can be as lucky as me.
If you find a Heart, Collect it!, It helps you to recover a bit.
