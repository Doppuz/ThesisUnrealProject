Why are you here?,You seem a little bit disoriented, You remember me of Zoro in One Piece who always gets lost.
**Why are you staring at me?!?!?**, Hi, Can I help you?, If yes - you are in the wrong place.
**Another hopeless adventurer... Let's try to be kind**,I am glad you found me, I was very upset here, no one ever come to talk with me, I see you have a lot things to do so I am not bothering you anymore, but if you wanna be my friends I am going to wait for you, Bye!
**Sound of a shot in the background**,Red light, Green light, Oh I got confused.
**What am I doing here?**, Don't bother me, I am busy, **Am I really busy?**.
keep going!, You are very closer to the end of the maze :), **Actually you are not, but that doesn't matter**.
Zero, One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Eight, Nine, Ten, I have missed number 7, Have you noticed?, If yes - well done!
I bless you, I hope you can get to the end, **Actually I don't care**.
It is very nice to walk here, especially in autumn, you should follow me to!
What happened?, Did you get lost?, **Again?!?!?!?**.
Hi dear!, there are several routes out here, you should have a look everywhere, **At least if you are interested**, enjoy!
There are some bad guys out there, Red squares shoot you from the distance, While Black squares follow you, Watch out and please be safe!
Hi Darling!, Keep going, You are doing great!, **I mean not that bad**.
Hi adventurer!, How are you?, I am keeping fit, You should try it aswell, Bye!
**The sunset today is stunning**, **And I am wonderful too**, Oh sorry I was overthinking, Please go on and don't consider me.
Hey, Watch out from white squares, if they see you you have to start over from the last door you have visited, And it is not a pleasure experience.
**This square is the ugliest I have ever seen**, Hi gorgeous, How can I help you?, If you need something I am fully available.
Have you ever seen any hats nearby?, I stumbled upon into one yesterday, They have different colors, Maybe you can be as lucky as me.
If you find a Heart, Collect it!, It helps you to recover a bit, You can find generally it in some dead end road.
